This repository contains basic R scripts that are committed once every four hours through GitHub actions. This work was made possible thanks to the extremely informative blogpost by [Simon Couch](https://blog--simonpcouch.netlify.app/blog/r-github-actions-commit/) and associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/simonpcouch/scheduled-commit-action).
